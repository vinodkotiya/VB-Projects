5	Support the Cluster Size.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	With the help of Cluster Size Splitting option you can save a lot of space<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up to 50%.In other splitting utility a common user can't specify the cluster size.If he enter<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the splitting size less than the cluster size then surely he will west a lot of space of his <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harddisk.Therefore it is recomended that use cluster size option according to your<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAT32 or FAT System with appropriate drive partition when splitted files to be stored in<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to harddrive.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	eg If your system has FAT32 and drive is F:\ of 12GB where  splitted files to be saved <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	thenSelect the option Cluster Size(FAT32 - 8 to16 GB)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Thus you can utilize your 100% Space.
